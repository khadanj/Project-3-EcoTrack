## Project Objective
EcoTrack is a full stack web application that helps everyday people understand and reduce their personal carbon footprint. Users can log daily activities like driving, eating, and energy usage, and the app tracks their environmental impact over time. Users can also set monthly reduction goals and monitor their progress.

## Tools Used
- **Frontend:** React (Hooks), Vite, CSS
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express (ES Modules)
- **Database:** MongoDB (Docker for local development, Atlas for production)
- **Authentication:** Passport.js (Local Strategy), bcrypt, express-session
- **Other:** ESLint, Prettier, Git, GitHub, Render

## Instructions to Build

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- Docker Desktop (for running MongoDB locally)
- Git

### Steps to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/TamiyooD02/Project-3-EcoTrack.git
```

2. Start MongoDB using Docker:
```
docker run -d -p 27017:27017 --name mongo mongo:latest
```

3. Set up the backend:
```
cd backend
npm install
```

4. Create a `.env` file inside the `backend` folder with the following:
```
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/ecotrack
SESSION_SECRET=ecotrack_secret_key_123
```

5. Start the backend server:
```
node seed.js
node index.js
```

6. Open a new terminal and set up the frontend:
```
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

7. Open your browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:5173
```

## Demo Account

If you just want to explore the app with the seeded data (~3,250 activities and ~750 goals), sign in with the demo account created by `seed.js`:

- **Email:** `demo@ecotrack.com`
- **Password:** `demo1234`

Newly registered users start with an empty log because every activity and goal is now scoped to its owner — you only see and manage your own records.

## How to Use the App

### 1. Create an Account
Visit the app and click **"Register here"** on the login page. Enter your name, email, and a password, then click **Register**. You'll be redirected to the login page — sign in with your new credentials.

### 2. Log an Activity
Once logged in you'll land on the **Log Activities** view. Use the form on the left to record an activity. Fill in the type (e.g. `driving`, `beef`, `electricity`), choose a category from the dropdown (transport, diet, or energy), enter a value and unit (e.g. `30 miles`), pick a date, and add an optional note. Click **Save Activity** to add it to your log.

### 3. View, Edit, and Delete Activities
Your logged activities appear in the list on the right. Click **Edit** on any entry to load it back into the form, make your changes, and click **Update Activity**. Click **Delete** to permanently remove an entry. Use the filter bar above the list to filter by category.

### 4. Set Goals
Click **Create Goals** in the navigation bar to switch to the goals view. Enter a title for your goal (e.g. `Reduce driving to under 50 miles/week`), add an optional description, and click **Save Goal**. Goals can be edited or deleted the same way as activities.

### 5. Logging Out
Click the **Logout** button in the top-right navigation bar to end your session.

## AI Usage Disclosure
- ReadMe.md template from project 2 was used and edited to create this ReadMe template: (exerpt from project 2) Gen AI (specifically Claude) was used to create a template of this README file before it was edited accordingly to match the scope of this project. The prompt was "Acting like your a senior full stack developer, provide a template of a readme file for an gihub repo of a project you just completed."
- Google search during process the building of the Passport Authentication which led to an AI overview. The prompt was "frontend can't tell the difference between a sucessful response and an error." No code was provided to me just an overview of Standard HTTP Status Codes and Practices for Differentiation.
