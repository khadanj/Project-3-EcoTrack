## Project Objective
EcoTrack is a full stack web application that helps everyday people understand and reduce their personal carbon footprint. Users can log daily activities like driving, eating, and energy usage, and the app tracks their environmental impact over time. Users can also set monthly reduction goals and monitor their progress.

## Tools Used
- **Frontend:** React (Hooks), Vite, CSS
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express (ES Modules)
- **Database:** MongoDB (Docker for local development, Atlas for production)
- **Authentication:** Passport.js (Local Strategy), bcrypt, express-session
- **Other:** ESLint, Prettier, Git, GitHub, Render

## AI Usage Disclosure
- ReadMe.md template from project 2 was used and edited to create this ReadMe template: (exerpt from project 2) Gen AI (specifically Claude) was used to create a template of this README file before it was edited accordingly to match the scope of this project. The prompt was "Acting like your a senior full stack developer, provide a template of a readme file for an gihub repo of a project you just completed."
- Google search during process the building of the Passport Authentication which led to an AI overview. The prompt was "frontend can't tell the difference between a sucessful response and an error." No code was provided to me just an overview of Standard HTTP Status Codes and Practices for Differentiation.
